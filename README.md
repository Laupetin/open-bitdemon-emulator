# Open BitDemon Emulator

This project aims to implement the BitDemon used for [DemonWare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonware)
backend services of some older games including Call Of Duty titles.

It is split into the library `libbitdemon` providing an interface for communicating
over the BitDemon protocol and `dw-server` which implements a very basic backend
for clients attempting to connect via the BitDemon protocol.

## Credits

Thank you to a person that does not want to be explicitly named for a lot of help
and laying the groundwork for understanding the protocol.
